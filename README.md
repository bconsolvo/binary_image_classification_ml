# binary_image_classification_ml

The Python program can be used for image classification in machine learning. It can be used to train and test whether or not an image belongs to one of 2 categories. 

This program uses a convolutional neural network (CNN). Keras is a powerful machine learning tool that uses Tensorflow backend, allowing users to implement complex neural networks with short Python code.

Many of the parameters can be adjusted. The best way to understand the parameters I used here is to read the Keras documentation at :
